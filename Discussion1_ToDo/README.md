# CEN 3031 - Discussion 1

In this discussion session, we will create a **ToDo App**.

I will be showing you how to make this app work. We will accomplish something like this:-

However, if time permits we will look into some UX stuff.

We will be going through a set of nine steps that I have created to understand how this works. These steps are as follows:-

* First Task - Write simple HTML for your Todo [HTML]
* Second Task - Create a list of tasks in Javascript/Angular and replace those tasks from the list into your html using Angular directives [Javascript, Angular ng-app]
* Third Task - Now replace your list of tasks in Javascript with a data structure that maintains whether you did a task or not [Javascript]
* Fourth Task - Bind the checkboxes to the data structure you created 
[Angular ng-model, CSS class]
* Fifth Task - Remove the redundancy in your code using ng-repeat "the For loop"  [Angular ng-repeat]
* Sixth Task -  Add a task to your list when you click the add button [Angular ng-submit]
* Seventh Task -  Highlight the text in red for those tasks that are done [CSS]
* Eighth Task -  Remove the tasks that we have completed when clicking on archive link [ng-click]
* Nineth Task -  Display actual number of tasks [Angular foreach loops]



If you want something more, try this to test your knowledge: 

  1. UX (apply Bootstrap)
  2. Delete buttons after every task instead of archive
  3. Ask the user for priority and color labels and sort the list on priority and add colors
